Discription of the task
Hobby animals need several things to preserve their exhilaration. Cathy has some hobby animals: fishes, birds, and dogs. Every animal has a name 
and their exhilaration level is between 0 and 100 (0 means that the animals dies). If their keeper is in a good mood, she takes care of everything 
to cheer up her animals, and their exhilaration level increases: of the fishes by 1, of the birds by 2, and of the dogs by 3. On an ordinary day, 
Cathy takes care of only the dogs (their exhilaration level does not change), so the exhilaration level of the rest decreases: of the fishes by 3, 
of the birds by 1. On a bad day, every animal becomes a bit sadder and their exhilaration level decreases: of the fishes by 5, of the birds by 3, 
and of the dogs by 10. Cathy’s mood improves by one if the exhilaration level of every alive animal is at least 5. Every data is stored in a text file. 
The first line contains the number of animals. Each of the following lines contain the data of one animal: one character for the type (F – Fish, 
B – Bird, D – Dog), name of the animal (one word), and the initial level of exhilaration. In the last line, the daily moods of Cathy are 
enumerated by a list of characters (g – good, o – ordinary, b – bad). The file is assumed to be correct. Name the animal of the lowest level of 
exhilaration which is still alive at the end of the simulation. If there are more, name all of them!
